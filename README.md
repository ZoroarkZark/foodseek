# FoodSeek

*A Food Social Media Platform*


## Goal
Our goal is to connect food insecure people (Our users) with free food.

## Method
Connect our users with food suppliers that are voiding or wasting some food. Get the supplier to hold the food for some amount of time for one of our users to pick the food up.




## Technical Breakdown

### Generally
In order to implement our goal with our method. We will need
  - A UI for both the User's and Suppliers. (front end react)
  - A shared data structure for them to read and write to. (back end in Node)
  - A method for them to comminucate (back end in Node)
  - Login system for returning user (SQL / Database)


### Specifically

**UI**

React or Expo

**Backend / Server**

For our back end we've decied to use Node.js. (v16.17.1)

Currently we have a method of running a server that can take requests (does not do anything with them). Need to learn more about how to implement the data structures as well as other important features within this server.

**Data Base**

SQL
Going to want to look into login systems and stuff
