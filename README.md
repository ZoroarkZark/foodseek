# Goal
Our goal is to connect food insecure people (Our users) with free food.

Connect our users with food suppliers that are voiding or wasting some food. Get the supplier to hold the food for some amount of time for one of our users to pick the food up.

# General Structure
In order to implement our goal with our method. We will need
  - A UI for both the User's and Suppliers. (front end react)
  - A shared data structure for them to read and write to. (back end in Node)
  - A method for them to comminucate (back end in Node)
  - Login system for returning user (SQL / Database)

# UI/Frontend

In order to create our UI for the app that we'll be making, we have decided to use React Native alongside Expo; this will allow us to create a project to put in all of our components.
In other words, we are using Expo for our front-end.

# Backend / Server

For our server we've decied to use Node.js. (v16.17.1)
For our database we are using mySQL version 8.0.30 with the InnoDB engine
