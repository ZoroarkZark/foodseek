# Background
> *The U.S. sends about 63 million tons of food to landfills each year... At the same time, 11 percent of U.S. households were food insecure in 2018. *(The Global Food Donation Policy Atlas. mapping the barriers to food donation. 2020)

Food retailers struggle with logistical and communicational barriers which may impede or prevent donations of their unsold food items. Risks associated with concerns for liability, transportation costs, and additional labor costs incurred to accomadate the donation process further discourages food retailers from donating. Design and implementation for this application must address these concerns by reducing risk for vendors and providing incentives for use wherever possible.

# Goal
Providing a convenient, quick, and easy-to-use interface for a consumer type user (hereinafter referred to as 'Seeker') to engage with food retailers (hereinafter referred to as FoodSeek 'Partners' or 'Vendors') for the purpose of reducing food waste and food insecurity.

# Features
  - Account Registration and login authentication for both of the user types (Seeker/Vendor).
    * Vendors can submit business location, contact details, menu, and hours of operations, as well as save preferences such as time limits for food cards and prefilled post templates.
    * Seekers can save favorites, set a default location, specify their preferred travel method for transit estimations, and set dietary preferences for auto-filtering search results.
  - Post creation and listing for advertising available donations.
    * Post creation for Vendors to submit formatted postings (_food cards_) with visual content provided from the uploaded menu, a device's camera, or the device photo gallery.
    * Post search/listing with filters for Seekers to view listings that are relevant to them based on dietary preferences/requirements, proximity, and acccessibility.
  - Reservation system
    * Helper animations/text explains a well defined transactional model for how this process will go. 
    * Confirmed reservations result in automatically sharing the necessary information between both parties so both can share expectations of service.
    * Standardized transactional model reduces time wasted by limiting the amount of communication necessary to facilitate the pickup.
    * A history of postings can be preserved to account for Vendor donations adding the option for the vendor to export data for their own purposes.
